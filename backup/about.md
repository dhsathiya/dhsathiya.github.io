So basically I am a Computer Engineer. I love my work and playing games.
I mostly want to learn everything about computers but don't have time.

Currently working at [rtCamp](https://www.rtcamp.com) as a Systems Engineer. I learn almost new things related to Web Servers and what not !

Okay this is all I know about my self.
